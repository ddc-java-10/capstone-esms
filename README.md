# Endangered Species Management System (ESMS)

A content management system designed to be used as an Android application for ease of
 use in the field, while traveling as well as in the office. A user, depending upon access rights, can 
 find and/or add/modify data regarding a given species of life. Personnel collect and organize data all 
 with the purpose of providing managers, administrators and legislators with the information needed 
 to determine the endangerment status of a species.
